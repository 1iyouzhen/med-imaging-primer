# Medical Imaging Primer

**English | [简体中文](README.zh.md)**

An open-source tutorial on medical imaging processing, providing a systematic guide from physical imaging principles, reconstruction algorithms to deep learning post-processing.

## 📖 About

This tutorial aims to help beginners systematically learn medical imaging processing technology. No medical or imaging background is required - we start from the basics of CT/MRI and gradually progress to advanced topics including reconstruction algorithms and AI-powered post-processing.
