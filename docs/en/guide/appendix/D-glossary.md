|English Term|Explanation|
| --------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|k-space|In MRI, refers to the original frequency domain data matrix collected, through which images are generated by Fourier transform.|
|T1-weighted|A contrast method of MRI sequences, emphasizing longitudinal relaxation characteristics, with clear structure.|
|T2-weighted|Another contrast method of MRI sequences, emphasizing transverse relaxation characteristics, with obvious display of liquid/edema.|
|Windowing (Window Width/Level)|In CT or X-ray image display, used to adjust grayscale range and midpoint to optimize contrast.|
|Flat-field correction|Corrects dark spots or streak artifacts in images caused by detector/illumination non-uniformity or inconsistent response.|
|SENSE (Sensitivity Encoding)|MRI parallel imaging technique that uses multiple coil sensitivity information to achieve scanning acceleration.|
|Parallel Imaging|Uses multiple receiving coils to sample simultaneously to reduce scanning time or improve resolution.|
|Echo Time (TE)|The time interval between RF pulse and signal acquisition start in MRI, affecting image contrast.|
|Repetition Time (TR)|The pulse cycle interval time in MRI, affecting signal recovery and contrast.|
|Flip Angle|The tilt angle of nuclear magnetic resonance caused by MRI radio frequency pulse, affecting signal intensity/contrast.|
|Field of View (FOV)|The anatomical region or volume size covered by imaging, usually expressed in mm.|
|Voxel|3D pixel, the smallest unit in medical imaging data.|
|Slice Thickness|The thickness of each image in tomographic scanning (CT/MRI), affecting volume reconstruction and partial volume effect.|
|Partial Volume Effect|When a voxel contains multiple tissue types, signal mixing leads to reduced accuracy.|
|Artifact|Non-real tissue structures in images introduced by equipment, patient movement, signal processing, etc.|
|Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)|The ratio of signal intensity to noise intensity in an image, measuring image quality.|
|Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)|The ratio of signal difference between lesion and background tissue to noise, reflecting recognizability.|
|Reconstruction Kernel|The filter type used during CT reconstruction, which affects sharpness and noise level.|
|Radiomics|Extracting large amounts of quantitative features (texture, shape, intensity, etc.) from images for modeling and analysis.|
|Segmentation|Classifying image pixels/voxels into different structures (such as organs, edema, tumors) for quantitative analysis.|
|Registration|Aligning images from different time points or different modalities to the same space for convenient comparison.|
|Deep Learning|Using deep neural networks (such as CNN, Transformer) to analyze/predict image data.|
|Transfer Learning|Applying a model trained on one task to another related task to reduce training costs.|
|Multimodal Learning|Fusing multiple imaging modalities (such as MRI + PET + genetic data) for joint analysis.|
|Overfitting|The phenomenon where a model performs well on training set but has poor generalization ability on new data.|
|Dice Coefficient|A metric that measures the degree of overlap between predicted and real regions in segmentation tasks.|
|Intersection over Union (IoU)|Used for segmentation evaluation: the ratio of the intersection of prediction and real regions to their union.|
|Sensitivity (Recall)|The proportion of true positives correctly identified in classification tasks.|
|Specificity|The proportion of true negatives correctly identified.|
|ROC Curve|A curve showing the relationship between false positive rate and true positive rate, used for classification evaluation.|
|Hounsfield Unit (HU)|Unit representing tissue density in CT: water is 0, air is approximately -1000.|
|Contrast Agent|Injected or taken before imaging to enhance contrast of certain tissues or blood vessels.|
|Dual-energy CT|Using two different energies of X-rays to contrast and enhance imaging material discrimination capability.|
|Ground-glass Opacity (GGO)|Mildly increased opacity in lung images where vascular texture is still visible.|
|Mass|Larger volume (usually >3 cm) possibly abnormal structure or tumor, requiring observation and differentiation.|
|Nodule|Smaller volume (usually <3 cm) structure, requiring follow-up for growth or malignancy.|
|Pleural Effusion|Fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity, appearing as fluid level or blurred boundary in images.|
|Cardiomegaly|Increased cardiothoracic ratio, suggesting cardiac structural abnormalities.|
|Calcification|Calcium deposition in tissues or lesions, visible as high density in CT or X-ray.|
|Infarct|Tissue necrosis caused by interrupted blood supply, with typical imaging manifestations in MRI/CT.|
|Ring Enhancement|In contrast-enhanced images, lesion edge enhancement with low signal/low density center, common in metastatic tumors or brain abscesses.|
|Spiculated Margin|Tumor edge with radiating spiky protrusions, suggesting invasiveness or malignancy.|
|Ghosting|Particularly in the phase encoding direction in MRI images, streaks or duplicate images caused by patient movement, etc.|
|Flip Angle|The tilt angle of nuclear magnetic resonance caused by MRI radio frequency pulse, affecting signal intensity/contrast.|
|Fourier Transform|Mathematical transformation that converts spatial domain signals to frequency domain (such as k-space to image domain).|
|Coil Sensitivity|Response differences of multi-channel MRI receiving coils at different spatial positions, used for parallel imaging.|
|Nyquist Frequency|Half of the lowest necessary sampling frequency in sampling theory, below which aliasing will occur.|
|Aliasing|When sampling is insufficient or FOV is too small, signals outside the image are repeated or overlapped in the image.|
