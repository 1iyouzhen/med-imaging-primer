# 5.1 Preprocessing (Modality-Specific Considerations)

> "Good preprocessing is the foundation of successful deep learning models—garbage in, garbage out." — The Golden Rule of Medical Image AI

In the previous chapters, we learned about medical imaging principles, reconstruction algorithms, and quality assessment. Now, we enter the deep learning era, facing new challenges: **how to prepare medical image data from different modalities into a format suitable for deep learning model input?**

Unlike natural images, medical images have unique physical characteristics and clinical requirements. CT Hounsfield units, MRI multi-sequence characteristics, X-ray contrast limitations—each modality requires specialized preprocessing strategies. This chapter will delve into these modality-specific preprocessing techniques to lay a solid foundation for subsequent deep learning tasks.

## 🏥 Medical Image Preprocessing Importance

### Medical Images vs Natural Images

Medical images differ fundamentally from the natural images we encounter in daily life:

| Characteristic         | Natural Images      | Medical Images                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Range**         | 0-255 (8-bit)       | Modality-specific (HU values, arbitrary units, etc.)               |
| **Physical Meaning**   | RGB color intensity | Physical measurements (attenuation, magnetization intensity, etc.) |
| **Standardization**    | Relatively standard | Highly dependent on equipment and scanning parameters              |
| **Region of Interest** | Entire image        | Specific tissues or lesions                                        |
| **Prior Knowledge**    | Limited             | Rich anatomical and physiological priors                           |

::: info 🧠 The "Appetite" of Deep Learning
Deep learning models, especially CNNs, typically expect:
- **Standardized input ranges**: such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]
- **Consistent resolution**: fixed image dimensions
- **Normalized contrast**: avoid certain channels dominating training
- **Noise and artifact removal**: improve model generalization ability

The core task of medical image preprocessing is to convert original physical measurements into a format that models "like."

### Hierarchy of Preprocessing

Medical image preprocessing can be divided into three levels:

## 🫧 CT Preprocessing Techniques

### Theoretical Foundation of HU Values

In Chapter 1, we learned the definition of Hounsfield Units (HU):

$$
HU = 1000 \times \frac{\mu_{tissue} - \mu_{water}}{\mu_{water} - \mu_{air}}
$$

This physically meaningful metric gives CT images **absolute comparability**—regardless of which hospital's scanner is used, water's HU value is always 0, and air is always -1000.

### Challenge: Dynamic Range vs Tissue of Interest

**Problem**: CT HU values range from -1000 (air) to +3000+ (dense bone or metal), while deep learning models typically struggle to handle such large dynamic ranges.

**Solution**: Windowing technology

#### Windowing Principles

Windowing maps HU values to display or processing ranges:

$$
I_{output} = \text{clip}\left(\frac{HU - \text{WindowLevel}}{\text{WindowWidth}} \times 255 + 128, 0, 255\right)
$$

Where:
- `WindowLevel`: Center HU value of the window
- `WindowWidth`: HU value range of the window
- `clip()`: Limits output to [0, 255] range

#### Clinically Common Windows

| Window Type            | Window Level | Window Width | Applicable Tissue      | Visible Structures                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Lung Window**        | -600         | 1500         | Lung tissue            | Lung markings, small nodules, pneumothorax     |
| **Mediastinal Window** | 50           | 350          | Mediastinal structures | Heart, great vessels, lymph nodes              |
| **Bone Window**        | 300          | 2000         | Bones                  | Cortical bone, bone marrow, microfractures     |
| **Brain Window**       | 40           | 80           | Brain tissue           | Gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid |
| **Abdominal Window**   | 50           | 400          | Abdominal organs       | Liver, pancreas, kidneys                       |

::: tip 💡 The Art of Window Selection
Window selection is like camera focusing:
- **Narrow window**: High contrast, rich details but limited range
- **Wide window**: Large coverage but reduced contrast
- **Multi-window strategy**: For complex tasks, multiple windows can be used as different input channels
:::

### HU Clipping and Outlier Handling

#### HU Clipping Strategy

```python
def clip_hu_values(image, min_hu=-1000, max_hu=1000):
    """
    HU value clipping: remove extreme values, retain tissue range of interest
    """
    # Deep copy to avoid modifying original data
    processed_image = image.copy()

    # Clip HU values
    processed_image[processed_image < min_hu] = min_hu
    processed_image[processed_image > max_hu] = max_hu

    return processed_image
```

**Common Clipping Ranges:**
- **Soft tissue range**: [-200, 400] HU (exclude air and dense bone)
- **Full body range**: [-1000, 1000] HU (include most clinically relevant structures)
- **Bone tissue range**: [-200, 3000] HU (suitable for bone analysis)

#### Metal Artifact Detection and Processing

Metal implants (such as dental fillings, hip prostheses) can produce extreme HU values and streak artifacts:

```python
def detect_metal_artifacts(image, threshold=3000):
    """
    Detect metal artifact regions
    """
    metal_mask = image > threshold

    # Connectivity analysis, remove isolated noise points
    from scipy import ndimage
    labeled_mask, num_features = ndimage.label(metal_mask)

    # Retain large-area metal regions
    significant_metal = np.zeros_like(metal_mask)
    for i in range(1, num_features + 1):
        if np.sum(labeled_mask == i) > 100:  # Minimum area threshold
            significant_metal[labeled_mask == i] = True

    return significant_metal
```

*CT lung nodule detection preprocessing pipeline: from raw DICOM to model input*

**Complete Preprocessing Pipeline:**
1. **DICOM reading**: Extract pixel data and HU value calibration information
2. **HU value conversion**: Apply rescale slope and intercept
3. **Lung region extraction**: Based on HU value thresholding and connectivity analysis
4. **Resampling**: Unify to isotropic resolution (e.g., 1mm³)
5. **Windowing**: Apply lung window (window level -600, window width 1500)
6. **Normalization**: Map to [0, 1] range
7. **Size adjustment**: Crop or padding to fixed size

## 🧲 MRI Preprocessing Techniques

### MRI Intensity Inhomogeneity Problem

#### Causes of Bias Field

MRI signal intensity inhomogeneity (bias field) is a common problem, mainly originating from:

1. **RF field inhomogeneity**: Coil sensitivity variations
2. **Gradient field nonlinearity**: Nonlinear distortion of gradient fields
3. **Tissue property variations**: Different tissue magnetic susceptibility differences
4. **Patient-related factors**: Body shape, respiratory motion, etc.

**Impact of bias field:**
- Same tissue shows different signal intensities at different locations
- Quantitative analysis (such as volume measurement) produces bias
- Deep learning models learn artifact features rather than true anatomical features

#### Bias Field Visualization

```python
def visualize_bias_field(image, corrected_image):
    """
    Visualize bias field correction effect
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

    # Original image
    axes[0].imshow(image, cmap='gray')
    axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
    axes[0].axis('off')

    # Bias field estimation
    bias_field = image / (corrected_image + 1e-6)
    axes[1].imshow(bias_field, cmap='hot')
    axes[1].set_title('Estimated Bias Field')
    axes[1].axis('off')

    # Corrected image
    axes[2].imshow(corrected_image, cmap='gray')
    axes[2].set_title('Corrected Image')
    axes[2].axis('off')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

### N4ITK Bias Field Correction Algorithm

#### N4ITK Algorithm Principle

**N4ITK** (N4 Iterative Bias Correction) is currently the most widely used bias field correction algorithm:

$$
I_{corrected}(x) = \frac{I_{original}(x)}{B(x)} + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- $I_{original}(x)$: Original signal intensity
- $B(x)$: Estimated bias field
- $\epsilon$: Small constant to avoid division by zero

**Algorithm Features:**
- Based on B-spline field bias field modeling
- Iterative optimization process
- Maintains tissue boundary integrity
- Effective for various MRI sequences

#### N4ITK Implementation

```python
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np
from dipy.denoise import bias_field_correction

class N4ITKBiasCorrector:
    """N4ITK bias field corrector implementation"""

    def __init__(self, max_iterations=50, shrink_factor=2):
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.shrink_factor = shrink_factor

    def correct_bias_field(self, image, output_path=None):
        """Execute N4ITK bias field correction"""
        # 1. Downsample for faster processing
        working_image = self._downsample(image)

        # 2. Iteratively optimize bias field
        bias_field = self._optimize_bias_field(working_image)

        # 3. Apply correction and restore resolution
        corrected_image = self._apply_correction(image, bias_field)

        return corrected_image
```

### White Stripe Intensity Normalization

#### White Stripe Algorithm Principle

**White Stripe** is a simple yet effective MRI intensity normalization method:

1. **Identify white matter region**: In brain MRI, white matter has relatively stable signal characteristics
2. **Extract white matter intensity range**: Find the dominant mode of white matter through statistical analysis
3. **Linear mapping**: Map white matter range to standard interval (e.g., [0, 1])

[📖 **Complete Code Example**: `white_stripe_normalization/`](https://github.com/datawhalechina/med-imaging-primer/tree/main/src/ch05/) - Full White Stripe normalization implementation with multi-modality support]

**Execution Results Analysis:**

```
White Stripe normalization:
  Modality: T1
  Original statistics: mean=152.3, std=87.6, range=[0, 255]
  White matter peak: intensity=164.2, width=16.4
  White matter range: [147.8, 180.6]
  Normalized statistics: mean=0.50, std=0.15, range=[0.0, 1.0]
```

**Algorithm Analysis:** White Stripe normalization identifies the white matter intensity peak through histogram analysis and uses it as a reference for intensity standardization. The execution results show that the original T1 image has a white matter peak at intensity 164.2 with a width of 16.4. By mapping the white matter range to [0, 1], the algorithm achieves intensity standardization across different scans while preserving tissue contrast relationships.

### Multi-sequence MRI Fusion Strategies

#### Value of Multi-sequence Information

Different MRI sequences provide complementary tissue information:

| Sequence                 | T1-weighted          | T2-weighted       | FLAIR              | DWI               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Tissue Contrast**      | Anatomical structure | Lesion detection  | Lesion boundary    | Cell density      |
| **CSF**                  | Low signal           | High signal       | Low signal         | b-value dependent |
| **White Matter Lesions** | Low contrast         | High contrast     | Very high contrast | Variable          |
| **Acute Infarction**     | Not obvious early    | High signal early | High signal        | Diffusion limited |

![MRI Multi-sequence Comparison](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349327938/figure/fig2/AS:989495652872194@1614926665094/Different-MRI-sequences-show-the-same-brain-tumor-The-T1-weighted-image-provides.ppm)
*Comparison of different MRI sequences for the same brain tumor, showing complementary information*

#### Multi-sequence Fusion Methods

[📖 **Complete Code Example**: `multisequence_fusion/`](https://github.com/datawhalechina/med-imaging-primer/tree/main/src/ch05/) - Multi-sequence MRI fusion implementation with different strategies]

**Execution Results Analysis:**

```
Multi-sequence fusion:
  Target shape: (128, 128, 128)
  Sequence alignment: T1, T2, FLAIR
  Resampling methods: linear
  Intensity normalization: Z-score
  Fusion strategy: channel stacking
  Output shape: (128, 128, 128, 3)
  Quality metrics: SNR=22.4, CNR=15.8
```

**Algorithm Analysis:** Multi-sequence fusion leverages complementary information from different MRI sequences. The execution results show that three sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR) are successfully aligned to a unified shape of (128, 128, 128) through linear interpolation and normalized using Z-score. The channel stacking strategy creates a 4D tensor with shape (128, 128, 128, 3), preserving both spatial and multi-sequence information. The quality metrics indicate good signal-to-noise ratio (22.4) and contrast-to-noise ratio (15.8), ensuring effective fusion for downstream analysis.

## 🦴 X-ray Preprocessing Techniques

### Characteristics and Challenges of X-ray Imaging

#### Inherent Contrast Limitations

The physical principles of X-ray imaging determine its contrast limitations:

1. **Tissue overlap**: 3D structures projected onto 2D plane
2. **Limited dynamic range**: Medical X-ray detectors have relatively limited dynamic range
3. **Scatter influence**: Scattered X-rays reduce image contrast
4. **Exposure parameter variations**: Different examinations use different exposure conditions

### CLAHE Contrast Enhancement

#### CLAHE Algorithm Principle

**CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) is an improved adaptive histogram equalization:

1. **Block processing**: Divide image into small blocks (e.g., 8×8)
2. **Local histogram equalization**: Perform histogram equalization independently for each block
3. **Contrast limiting**: Limit histogram peaks to avoid noise amplification
4. **Bilinear interpolation**: Use bilinear interpolation at block boundaries for smooth transition

![CLAHE Effect Comparison](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329926497/figure/fig2/AS:707726086393860@1545445274664/Comparison-of-CHEST-X-RAY-image-enhanced-with-CLAHE.png)

    return clip_limit, tile_size
```

### Lung Field Segmentation and Normalization

#### Clinical Significance of Lung Field Segmentation

**Lung field segmentation** is a key step in chest X-ray processing:

1. **Region focusing**: Focus processing on lung regions
2. **Background suppression**: Remove interference from regions outside lungs
3. **Standardization**: Standardize lung size and position across different patients
4. **Prior utilization**: Utilize lung anatomical prior knowledge

#### Deep Learning-based Lung Field Segmentation

## 🔧 Common Preprocessing Methods

### Resampling and Resolution Standardization

#### Why Resampling is Needed?

Medical images from different sources may have different spatial resolutions:

| Modality  | Typical Resolution                                | Resolution Variation Reasons                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CT**    | 0.5-1.0mm (in-plane), 0.5-5.0mm (slice thickness) | Scanning protocols, reconstruction algorithms |
| **MRI**   | 0.5-2.0mm (anisotropic)                           | Sequence types, acquisition parameters        |
| **X-ray** | 0.1-0.2mm (detector size)                         | Magnification, detector type                  |

#### Resampling Methods

def resample_medical_image(image, original_spacing, target_spacing, method='linear'):
    """
    Medical image resampling

### Data Augmentation: Medical-specific Techniques

#### Special Considerations for Medical Image Data Augmentation

Medical image data augmentation needs to consider:

1. **Anatomical reasonableness**: Augmented images must maintain anatomical correctness
2. **Clinical significance**: Augmentation should not alter key pathological features
3. **Modality characteristics**: Different modalities are suitable for different augmentation strategies

#### Spatial Transform Augmentation

def medical_spatial_augmentation(image, labels=None, augmentation_params=None):
    """
    Medical image spatial transform augmentation
    """

            'scaling_range': 0.1,  # 10%

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

#### Preprocessing Pitfalls

| Pitfall Type                 | Specific Manifestation                 | Consequences                             | Solutions                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Over-smoothing**           | Using Gaussian filtering for denoising | Loss of details, small lesions disappear | Use edge-preserving denoising         |
| **Improper normalization**   | Global statistics normalization        | Abnormal regions suppressed              | Local or adaptive normalization       |
| **Information leakage**      | Using test set statistics              | Overly optimistic performance            | Use only training set statistics      |
| **Anatomical discontinuity** | Excessive spatial transforms           | Anatomical structure destruction         | Reasonable transform parameter limits |

### Practical Application Recommendations

**Choosing appropriate preprocessing strategies:**

1. **Select core algorithms based on modality**
   - CT: HU value clipping + windowing adjustment
   - MRI: Bias field correction + White Stripe normalization
   - X-ray: CLAHE enhancement + local segmentation

2. **Parameter optimization principles**
   - Start conservatively, enhance gradually
   - Use cross-validation to determine optimal parameters
   - Combine quantitative evaluation with visual effects

3. **Quality check key points**
   - Maintain anatomical structure integrity
   - Avoid over-processing or information loss
   - Ensure processing results conform to medical common sense

**Code usage guide:**
Each algorithm has complete documentation and test cases. We recommend:
1. First run synthetic data examples to understand algorithm effects
2. Use your own data for parameter optimization
3. Establish quality check processes to ensure processing effects
